Description: 

  Pyano is a web interface for the mixmaster remailer written for
  mod_python.

  It aims to be easy to install and get working, while remaining quite
  configurable, both in its interaction with mixmaster and in its
  appearance. It is heavily inspired by the mixweb perl script at
  cotse.net.

  This program assumes:
    - Python (>=2.6)
    - A functionning mixmaster client.
    - Apache2 with mod_python enabled

  Further functionnality is available if the host is a pinger.

Installation:

  1. Place the pyano module on your python path. There are several
     ways of doing this:
      * Use distutils. Type in the folder where you extracted the 
      	pyano sources:
              python setup.py install  
	this will install the pyano module on your system's python
	path.

      * Or simply simply add the following line
      	in your apache configuration:
	     PythonPath "sys.path+['/path/to/parent']"
	where parent is the folder containing the pyano module.

  2. Copy and edit the pyano.cfg.example file to adapt the options to
  your server. The only parameter that MUST be set correctly is the
  path to the mixmaster binary.

  3. To activate the email interface on http://hostname/foo/pyanomail,
  add the following snippet to your apache configuration:
  
    <Location /foo/pyanomail>
       SetHandler python-program
       PythonHandler pyano.mail
       PythonOption config_file /path/to/pyano.cfg
    </Location>


  4. To activate the usenet interface on
  http://hostname/foo/pyanonews, add the following snippet to your
  apache configuration:
     
     <Location /foo/pyanonews> 
        SetHandler python-program
	PythonHandler pyano.news
	PythonOption config_file /path/to/pyano.cfg
     </Location>


  5. To activate the email blocking interface on
  http://hostname/foo/pyanoblock, add the following snippet to your
  apache configuration:
     
     <Location /foo/pyanoblock> 
        SetHandler python-program
	PythonHandler pyano.block
	PythonOption config_file /path/to/pyano.cfg
